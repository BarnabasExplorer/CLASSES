The CLASSES repository was created due to a sudden hiatus of classes during spring 2020
This repository is meant to be a place where BR faculty can upload template files for the most current state of their classes (code, wiring diagrams, etc.)
Students can access files for their classes and continue using online curriculum and/or online instruction from home
FOR BR FACULTY: please create your own folder within this repository labelled with your name and the semseter. EL_S20 can be used as an example
